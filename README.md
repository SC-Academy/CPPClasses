## C++ Classes and Objects Example

This example demonstrates how to create classes and objects in C++, two key concepts in Object Oriented Programming.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

You need a C++ compiler to build and run this program. If you don't have one installed, you can download and install one like [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

### Or Use IDE
1. Download and install CodeBlocks or any C++ IDE if you do not already have it installed.
2. Download the main.cpp file.
3. Add it to your C++ project.
4. Run the project application.


### Code Explanation

The first two lines, `#include <iostream>` and `#include <string>`, include the necessary header files for using input/output and string operations.

The third line, `using namespace std;`, tells the compiler to use the standard namespace, which contains many common functions and classes.

The next section of code defines the `Student` class. This class has three private data members: `name`, `age`, and `gpa`. It also has one public member function: `displayInfo()`.

The `Student()` constructor initializes the data members of the `Student` object. The `displayInfo()` function prints the student's information to the console.

The `main()` function creates two `Student` objects: `student1` and `student2`. It then calls the `displayInfo()` function on each object to print their information to the console.
